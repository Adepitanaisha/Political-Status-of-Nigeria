<strong> NIGERIA IS NOT POLITICALLY RIPE FOR A FEMALE PRESIDENT</strong>
<p>To start with, let's take a look at the smallest social unit which is the Family. It is okay to say that the Father provide financially for the Family but the adequate decision making to smoothen the process of the Family is made by the Mother. But the fact that the Father provide financially for the family is now questioned as there are many Mothers out there that cater for the Family in place of the Father. The way they provide for the Family, financially, they also make adequate decisions for the family. So with this are you telling me that a "Female can't rule the Country" cause, is said that 'Charity begins from Home'. So,for a Female to be ripe enough to take adequate care of the family, Why can't they take care of the society at large?</p>
<p>Also, let's looks at the Economic State and 
Crisis of this country which is said to be ruled by Male. We have a Falling Economy. An Economy that depreciates
day by day, an economy that don't value the youths. An Economy that counts Education as a Child's play and don't pay respect to who are to be respected. A country that is supposed to be democratic is now ruled by the few privileged. You are now telling me that the Male should continue with their Dubious and Corrupt acts? When they can't even provide a Well defined Economy and you say this Country is not ripe for a Female Leader? Following the well known saying, that "What a man
can do a Woman can do better". So, are you telling me that a Female can't place a positive impact in the Society. Female naturally are compassionate, considerate with a whole lot of set goals and values to achieve, Female are great influencers compared to those, Crooks we are up there to play only in their personal interest.</p>

<p>Furthermore, let's take a look at other Successful Female leaders and how they've made positive impacts in the world. A perfect example is the Great Britain which is among the Top 5 countries
in the World. The Queen Of England, the Head of Affairs over there is ruling them fine, and making a Positive Change in the World. With the Female Leader, the Country grows Economically, Socially, Politically compared to many other Countries ruled by Male. Nigeria in population and diversity is a smaller portion compared to the United Kingdom. So are you still placing it to me that a Female is not ripe enought to rule this Country?</p>

<p>Moreover, Saying that Nigeria is not yet ripe for a female Leader is a violation
to the Human Right. According to the Universal Declaration of Human
Right Published in the year 1945, a portion of the Fundamental Human Right states that "There is Right to  Freedom of Non-discrimination, Equality before
the Law and Equal Protection by the Law". So, the female,  should not be segregated
from the Political affairs of the States, that is, the power should be shuffled between the Male and Female to ensure Political Stability.</p>
<p>So, with all I have stated and placed
before you, with due respect, backed up by adequate evidence. I now state that "Nigeria is Politically Ripe for a Female is President". IT IS TIME FOR A GREAT REVOLUTIONARY</p>
